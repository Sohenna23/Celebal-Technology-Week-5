## Description
This repository contains the week 5 assignment for the SQL Domain as part of the CT_CSI_SQL_6421 course.It includes SQL scripts and queries designed to demonstrate understanding of core SQL concepts such as:

- Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Data retrieval using SELECT statements
- Filtering, sorting, and grouping data
- Use of aggregate functions
- Joins between multiple tables

In Week 5 of my SQL learning journey, I explored Common Table Expressions (CTEs), including recursive CTEs, and practiced writing queries using them. I also completed an assignment where I created a stored procedure to handle a Subject Change Request problem. Additionally, I solved several SQL problems on LeetCode to strengthen my understanding.
